## IMC Prosperity 2
### Rounds

The 15 days of simulation of Prosperity are divided into 5 rounds. Each round lasts 72 hours. At the end of every round - before the timer runs out - all teams will have to submit their algorithmic and manual trades to be processed. The algorithms will then participate in a full day of trading against the Prosperity trading bots. Note that all algorithms are trading separately, there is no interaction between the algorithms of different players. When a new round starts, the results of the previous round will be disclosed and the leaderboard will be updated accordingly. During the game, you can always visit previous rounds in the dashboard, to review information and results. But once a round is closed, you can no longer change your submitted trades for that round. When round 5 ends, the final results will be processed and the winner of the Prosperity trading challenge will be crowned “Prosperity Trading Tycoon”.

### Algorithmic trading

Every round contains an algorithmic trading challenge. You will have 72 hours to submit your (final) Python program. When the round ends, the last successfully processed submission will be locked in and processed for results.
### Manual trading

All rounds contain a manual trading challenge. Just like the algorithmic challenge, manual trading challenges last 72 hours to submit your (final) trade. When the round ends, the last submission will be locked in and processed for results. During the tutorial round, manual trading is inactive. Note that manual trades have no effect on your algorithmic trade and can be seen as separate challenges to gain additional profits. 

# Round 1

## Algorithm challenge

The first two tradable products are introduced: `STARFRUIT` and `AMETHYSTS`. While the value of the `AMETHYSTS` has been stable throughout the history of the archipelago, the value of `STARFRUIT` has been going up and down over time. Develop your initial trading strategy and write your first Python program to get off to a good start in this world of trading and market making. Even if the price of a product moves very little or in a very unpredictable way, there might still be clever ways to profit if you both buy and sell.

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- `STARFRUIT`: 20
- `AMETHYSTS`: 20

Results for round 1: Rank #411 global and Rank #15 Vietnam
